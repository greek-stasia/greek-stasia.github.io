# Getting Started

Welcome to my terminal-style portfolio! This post will help you navigate and interact with the site.

## How to Navigate

This site features an interactive terminal interface. Here's how to use it:

### Basic Commands

- **`help`** - Display all available commands and their usage
- **`ls`** - List all available sections you can navigate to
- **`cd <section>`** - Navigate to a specific section (e.g., `cd blog`, `cd projects`)
- **`clear`** - Clear the terminal screen

### Navigation Tips

1. Type commands just like you would in a real terminal
2. Use the up/down arrow keys to navigate through command history
3. Try `ls` first to see what sections are available
4. Use `cd` to explore different areas of the site

## Explore the Site
